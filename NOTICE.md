## pumpX2 (protocol origin)
The Tandem pump message framing, opcodes, pairing (JPAKE), and HMAC signing are ports of the
protocol reverse-engineered by **[pumpX2](https://github.com/jwoglom/pumpx2)** (© 2022 James Woglom,
MIT License). Outgoing messages are validated byte-for-byte against pumpX2's `cliparser` oracle,
which is included as a git submodule under `vendor/pumpx2-oracle` (retains its own MIT LICENSE).

## Mbed TLS (vendored crypto)
The EC-JPAKE implementation uses **[Mbed TLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls)**, included as a
git submodule under `vendor/mbedtls` and dual-licensed **Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later**
(© The Mbed TLS Contributors). Only the EC-JPAKE C sources are compiled, via symlinks into the
submodule; their SPDX headers are retained.

## Trademarks
