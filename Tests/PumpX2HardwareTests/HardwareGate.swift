// HardwareGate.swift — env-driven gates for the Tier-1 hardware bench harness.
//
// SKIP, NEVER FAIL. Absence of a pump / config flag => the relevant suite or test is SKIPPED (green),
// exactly like the oracle gate `@Suite(.enabled(if: OracleRunner.isAvailable))`
// (Tests/PumpX2MessagesTests/OracleParityTests.swift:7). A no-hardware checkout and CI stay green.
//
// SAFETY: the two delivery software walls are NOT touched here — they stay armed at all times
//   (1) `PumpBLEClient.WritePolicy` default `.readOnly` (Sources/PumpX2BLE/PumpBLEClient.swift:85)
//   (2) `Packetize` `actionsAffectingInsulinDeliveryEnabled` gate (Sources/.../Core/Packetize.swift:49)
// The harness only ELEVATES a policy for the exact op that needs it, scoped by `withWritePolicy`
// (auto-restores `.readOnly`), and only sets `allowInsulinDelivery` for a delivery-class message.
//
// TWO CONFIGURATION AXES the owner selects by env (both skip-not-fail when a config isn't present):
//   • Cartridge axis — PUMP_CARTRIDGE_LOADED absent = NO cartridge (what the owner has now): only
//     read-only / no-delivery cases run; every delivery case SKIPS. Delivery is enabled only when
//     PUMP_CARTRIDGE_LOADED=1 + PUMP_SALINE_ATTESTED=1 + PUMPX2_DELIVER_SALINE=1.
//   • CGM axis — PUMP_CGM_PRESENT absent = NO CGM (current): pump EGV reads are expected empty/stale
//     and CGM-dependent *app* behavior is out of scope for the pump. PUMP_CGM_PRESENT=1 = a sensor is
//     connected: the CGM read cases run and assert the pump's OWN CGM path reflects a live reading.
