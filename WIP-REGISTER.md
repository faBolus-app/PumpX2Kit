| # | Item | Evidence | Disp. | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~~`remediation/audit-round3-2026-07-24` is a bare label — identical SHA to `main`~~ **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-04 — DO NOT DELETE THIS BRANCH** | now **2 commits ahead** of `main` (`b157efa`, `4fbe4df`); pushed, upstream set | **F** | True when captured (`main` was still `802b921`), and **dangerous now**: the branch carries the only copy of the pump-authoritative trend-arrow API (`HomeScreenMirrorResponse.cgmTrendArrow`, `CurrentEgvGuiDataV2Response.trendArrow -> String?`) that faBolus's own round-3 commits require. Following the original "delete after the `deprecated` tag" disposition would break the faBolus build. Correct action: **merge to `main`** (master plan P3, and it must merge *first* — it is the only repo whose CI has no cross-repo inputs). **RESOLVED — merged to `main`** (round-3 landed; `main` @ `a026279`). |
| 2 | Stale "NOT yet hardware-tested" doc comments | `Sources/PumpX2BLE/PumpBLEClient.swift:24`, `Sources/PumpX2BLE/PumpX2BLE.swift:7` | **F** | Contradicted by `PINNED.md:34-51`, which records a 2026-07-18 on-hardware pass (JPAKE pairing, reads, a signed 0.10 u bolus delivered). A false *pessimistic* claim is still a false claim — v3 §13 requires every displayed/stated fact to trace to something real. Correct the wording to name exactly what was and was not exercised. **RESOLVED 2026-08-07 (P16 close-out):** both comments corrected — `PumpBLEClient.swift` and `PumpX2BLE.swift` now state the JPAKE (2026-07-18) and legacy-V1 (2026-08-07) on-hardware passes recorded in `PINNED.md`, note the BLE path validates via `PumpX2BenchHarness` (not `swift test`), and name the cartridge-gated items still outstanding. |
| 3 | CONTROL_STREAM (A3) cartridge-fill progress feedback deferred | `Sources/PumpX2Messages/Requests/Control/CartridgeFillRequests.swift:6-7` | **R** | Requests are ported; the stream consumer is not, and faBolus has no cartridge UI. Blocks nothing today. |
| 4 | The protocol port is knowingly partial | `scripts/coverage_report.py:6` — a tool exists solely to list upstream message classes with no Swift type | **F** | Run it and record the gap. v3 §2.4 wants the abstraction assessed; knowing which messages are missing is an input to that. |
| 5 | Pending hardware niceties: mass/accuracy check at a larger dose; cancel *mid*-delivery for partial-delivery reporting | `PINNED.md:52-53` | **R** | Bench-gated. The mid-delivery cancel gap matters for v3 defect group B — a cancel that races a completing dose is exactly the indeterminate case. **BOOKED 2026-08-04** as Objectives 1 & 3 of [`docs/BENCH-SESSION-PLAN.md`](docs/BENCH-SESSION-PLAN.md) — scheduled with item 12 into one saline session (master-plan P7: schedule it, don't rediscover it). |
| 6 | `PUMPX2_ALLOW_ORACLE_SKIP=1` — the single lever that silently drops all byte-parity coverage for 4 oracle-gated suites | `Tests/PumpX2MessagesTests/OracleAvailabilityGateTests.swift:16`; suites at `OracleParityTests.swift:7`, `ResponseParityTests.swift:7`, `HistoryLogEventsTests.swift:18`, `JpakeInteropTests.swift:10` | **N** | Working as designed and fail-closed: no CI job sets it, and nothing currently skips. Recorded so nobody "fixes" a red build by setting it. **Never set this.** |
| 7 | `scripts/test.sh` — a Command-Line-Tools-only `swift test` wrapper whose own header says it is unnecessary once full Xcode is installed | `scripts/test.sh:1-27` | **F** | **VERIFIED 2026-08-04: full Xcode _is_ installed** (`xcodebuild -version` → Xcode 26.6, build 17F113, at `/Applications/Xcode.app`), so `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md:44` is correct and the wrapper's premise no longer holds. **RESOLVED 2026-08-07 (P16 close-out):** header rewritten to state the wrapper is a convenience, not a necessity (Xcode is installed; CI runs plain `swift test`). The file is KEPT — it is the CLT-only test path and its behavior is unchanged. Recorded now because the verification was the actual task, and because the wrapper being unnecessary means **the watch/iOS/macOS targets are all buildable locally** — which is what let the 32-bit `glucoseEpochSec` overflow be caught (faBolus `c7b103c`) rather than shipped. |
| 8 | **`.unsafeFlags` on `CMbedTLSJPAKE` prevents PumpX2Kit from ever being consumed as a versioned SwiftPM dependency** | `Package.swift:37`; faBolus pins by local path at `faBolus/project.yml:40-41` ("Pin to a released version once PumpX2Kit tags v0.1.0") | **F** | **This is a hard blocker for v3 §1.3**, which requires semantic versioning on the backend with apps pinning explicit versions. SwiftPM refuses `unsafeFlags` in a version-pinned dependency. Resolving it means moving `-DMBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE` into the header/`cSettings` via `.define`, or vendoring a pre-configured config header. **DECLARED UNMET 2026-08-07 (P16 close-out, owner decision):** version-pinning is NOT achieved and NOT attempted — the `.unsafeFlags`/mbedtls-vendoring refactor is deferred and local-path consumption stays. There are in fact TWO `.unsafeFlags` sites (`Package.swift:37` crypto — the real blocker in the `PumpX2Auth`/`PumpX2BLE` closure faBolus consumes; `Package.swift:69` harness linker on the non-consumed executable). `v0.1.0` (annotated) and `v0.2.0` (lightweight) tags now exist, but no `v0.3.0` and no committed `Package.resolved`. Contract + declaration written into `CONTRIBUTING.md`/`AGENTS.md` (§1.3). Remains a standing WIP item. |
| 9 | `Sources/PumpX2BenchHarness` — a shipped executable product with no test target, exercised only manually behind `PUMPX2_DELIVER_SALINE=1` | `main.swift:324,350` | **N** | Correct posture for a hardware bench tool. |
| 10 | ~~compile inputs are symlinks generated by `link-mbedtls.sh`, **not committed**~~ **CORRECTED 2026-08-04 — the original entry was wrong** | `git ls-files -s Sources/CMbedTLSJPAKE/mbedtls_lib` → **13 entries, all mode `120000`** | **N** | The symlinks **are** committed (git preserves them), which is exactly why CI works with `submodules: recursive` and why no CI step invokes the script. `link-mbedtls.sh` is a maintenance tool, to be re-run only if the mbedTLS file set changes. What a fresh clone lacks is the **submodule** the links point into, not the links. Acting on the original entry — "a fresh clone must run that script" — would have been harmless; acting on its premise (that the links are untracked and should be generated) would break the build. Nothing to do. |
| 11 | `scripts/port_message.py` emits `// TODO(port):` markers into generated Swift | `:186, :200, :210, :239` | **N** | Generator templates, not live markers. No file in `Sources/` currently contains a `TODO(port)` — the port is clean. |
| 12 | **BENCH FOLLOW-UP (R3-D):** transaction correlation could be tightened from `(characteristic, opCode)` FIFO to also match the wire txId (`frame[1]`), letting two identical in-flight opcodes coexist safely and retiring the delivery-class serialization. | `Sources/PumpX2BLE/PumpTransactionCoordinator.swift` `ingest()` note; `Pending.txId` is retained for exactly this | **R** | **Gated on a hardware fact:** does a Tandem response reliably ECHO the request txId in `frame[1]`? Neither the code nor the vendored oracle establishes it, and matching on a txId the pump does not echo would fail EVERY correlation → break all pump comms. Until confirmed on the bench, R3-D closes the cross-resolve hazard with **delivery-class serialization** (owner decision 2026-08-04: serialize boluses now, investigate txId-match later). When bench time is available: capture a few request/response pairs, confirm `response.frame[1] == request.txId`, and if so add `&& frame[1] == entry.txId` to `ingest` + drop the `serialized` gate. **BOOKED 2026-08-04** as Objective 2 of [`docs/BENCH-SESSION-PLAN.md`](docs/BENCH-SESSION-PLAN.md) — bundled with item 5's mid-delivery cancel into one saline session. |

## P16 close-out reconciliation (2026-08-07)

Re-disposition of every open item against `main` @ `a026279`, with evidence. Inline cell notes above
carry the same status.

| # | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **RESOLVED** | round-3 merged to `main` (`main` @ `a026279`; the trend-arrow API the faBolus build needs is present). |
| 2 | **RESOLVED** | stale "NOT yet hardware-tested" comments corrected in `Sources/PumpX2BLE/PumpBLEClient.swift` and `Sources/PumpX2BLE/PumpX2BLE.swift` to match the `PINNED.md` JPAKE (2026-07-18) + legacy-V1 (2026-08-07) passes; wording only, no behavior change. |
| 3 | **STANDING BENCH HOLD** (reaffirmed) | CONTROL_STREAM cartridge-fill progress consumer still deferred; no cartridge UI depends on it. Bench-gated; blocks nothing. |
| 4 | open (R) | protocol port knowingly partial; `scripts/coverage_report.py` still lists the gap. Out of scope for P16 governance/licensing. |
| 5 | **STANDING BENCH HOLD** (reaffirmed) | mass/accuracy at a larger dose + mid-delivery cancel — booked in `docs/BENCH-SESSION-PLAN.md`; needs a real pump + saline. |
| 6 | **CONFIRMED never set** | no CI job sets `PUMPX2_ALLOW_ORACLE_SKIP`; the new `sbom-provenance` job does not touch it; the oracle suite runs full. **Never set this.** |
| 7 | **RESOLVED** | `scripts/test.sh` header rewritten to "convenience, not a necessity"; file KEPT (CLT-only test path), behavior unchanged. |
| 8 | **DECLARED UNMET** (owner, 2026-08-07) | version-pinning not achieved and not attempted — the `.unsafeFlags` (`Package.swift:37` crypto blocker + `:69` harness) / mbedtls-vendoring refactor is deferred; local-path consumption stays. §1.3 contract + declaration written into `CONTRIBUTING.md`/`AGENTS.md`. Standing item. |
| 12 | **STANDING BENCH HOLD** (reaffirmed) | txId-match tightening; booked in `docs/BENCH-SESSION-PLAN.md`. The 2026-08-07 legacy-pump probe observed reliable txId echo on reads (see `PINNED.md`), but the R3-D delivery-class serialization is retired only after a saline-session confirmation — hold stays open. |

Items 9/10/11 remain **N** (working as designed). Governance/licensing landed this pass:
`BRANCHES.md` stub, `CHANGELOG.md`, `THIRD_PARTY.md`, `docs/SBOM.md` + `scripts/check-sbom.sh`
(non-blocking CI job), `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, and the §1.3/§1.4
sections in `AGENTS.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Negative results

- No `FIXME`, `HACK`, or `XXX` anywhere. The only strict `TODO` hits are the generator templates above.
- No Swift `#if` compilation conditions at all in `Sources/` or `Tests/` — the only preprocessor use is
  C header guards in `Sources/CMbedTLSJPAKE/include/`.
- No `exclude:` in `Package.swift`; every `Sources/` and `Tests/` directory is wired to a target.
- No `XCTSkip*`, `func x_test`, `@Test(.disabled`, or commented-out test bodies. Skipping is expressed
  only through `.enabled(if: OracleRunner.isAvailable)`, backed by the fail-closed gate in item 6.
- No `fatalError` / `preconditionFailure` / `unimplemented` in `Sources/` or `Tests/`.
- Zero commented-out code blocks over 5 lines.
- `vendor/pumpx2-oracle` and `vendor/mbedtls` are upstream submodules and were excluded from all
  content scans.
